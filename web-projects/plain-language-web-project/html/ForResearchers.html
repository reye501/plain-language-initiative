                <p>•	Note: For EU regulation, list the number of subjects included in the trial in the Member State concerned, in the Union and in third countries. For FDA/U.S. regulation, list the country/countries (or state(s)) where trials were held. Also list age group breakdown and gender breakdown, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion and exclusion criteria should be the most important and relevant ones (5 or less). Additionally, any technical criteria should not be included if the participant would not likely be familiar with. Include if there were any direct benefits to participation. </p>
